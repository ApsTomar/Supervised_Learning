#### Dataset for Regression Algorithms: "house_price" dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction

##### Attributes Information (total features = 19):
   1. id: notation for house
   2. date: date house was sold
   3. price: house price (prediction target)
   4. bedrooms: number of bedrooms
   5. sqft_living: square footage of house
   6. yr_built: built year of house
   
   and so on...
